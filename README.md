# Python_CSV_editor
This is a web based application which is using Dash and Flask. It is basically taking a CSV file which can do CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operation easily.

# CSV file
It is a dummy data which I have used to do CRUD oppperations and then using that plot a graph.

# How to run
To run the program just install all the three files at a same place and pip install every library which I have used.
